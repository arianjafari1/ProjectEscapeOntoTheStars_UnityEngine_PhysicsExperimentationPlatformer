# ProjectEscapeOntoTheStars_UnityEngine_PhysicsExperimentationPlatformer
This game is a programming experiment, where I learnt how to play with physics in the Unity Engine and code in C# using the engine's library. The project is complete, but not to the point where I put it up on a storefront, also check out the Game Design document to see what the game would look like were it completely done design-wise.

In this project I also apply the best programming and Unity engine practices that I knew at the time, making the game as scalable as possible. This project is older, I am a more experience programmer now, but I upgraded the project to work on a newer Unity version, LTS 2022.3.15f1
