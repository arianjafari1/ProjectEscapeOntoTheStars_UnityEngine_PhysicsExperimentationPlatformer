# ProjectEscapeOntoTheStars_UnityEngine_PhysicsExperimentationPlatformer
This game is a programming experiment, where I learnt how to play with physics in the Unity Engine and code in C# using the engine's library. The project is complete, but not to the point where I put it up on a storefront, also check out the Game Design document to see what the game would look like were it completely done design-wise.
